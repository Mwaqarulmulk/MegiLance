# ✅ ENDPOINTS ACTIVATION COMPLETE - December 6, 2025

## Summary

**Issue Identified:** Only 95/120 endpoints were active. 4 modules were disabled due to perceived "import issues"

**Root Cause:** The modules actually imported fine - they were commented out in `routers.py` unnecessarily

**Solution Applied:** 
1. Added imports for 4 disabled modules
2. Enabled their routers in API registration
3. Verified all endpoints load successfully

  ```

- **Enabled 4 routers** (lines 355-365):
  ```python
  # Multi-Currency Payments
  api_router.include_router(multicurrency.router, ...)

  # Advanced AI
  api_router.include_router(ai_advanced.router, ...)

  # Admin Fraud Alerts
  api_router.include_router(admin_fraud_alerts.router, ...)
