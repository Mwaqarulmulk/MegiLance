## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The Issue
The BACKEND_STATUS_REPORT.md showed:
```
Endpoints: ✅ 95/120 Active
```

This indicated only **79%** of endpoints were working, with 4 modules disabled.

### Root Cause
In `/app/api/routers.py`, 4 modules were **commented out as disabled**:
- `multicurrency` 
- `ai_advanced`
- `admin_fraud_alerts`
- `admin_analytics`

These modules were marked "DISABLED (will fix imports)" but testing showed they **imported perfectly fine**.

### The Solution
1. **Added imports** to the routers.py imports section:
   ```python
   multicurrency, ai_advanced, admin_fraud_alerts, admin_analytics
   ```

2. **Uncommented 4 router registrations**:
   ```python
   # Multi-Currency Payments
   api_router.include_router(multicurrency.router, prefix="/multicurrency", tags=["multicurrency"])
   
   # Advanced AI
   api_router.include_router(ai_advanced.router, prefix="/ai-advanced", tags=["ai-advanced"])
   
   # Admin Fraud Alerts
   api_router.include_router(admin_fraud_alerts.router, prefix="/admin/fraud-alerts", tags=["admin-fraud"])
   
   # Admin Analytics
   api_router.include_router(admin_analytics.router, prefix="/admin", tags=["admin-analytics"])
   ```

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Test 1: Module Imports
```python
✓ multicurrency imports OK
✓ ai_advanced imports OK
✓ admin_fraud_alerts imports OK
✓ admin_analytics imports OK
```

### Test 2: Backend Startup
```
✅ Server initialized for asgi
✅ Database already initialized (25 tables found)
✅ All services loaded successfully
✅ Application startup complete
```

### Test 3: Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/ready
Response: {"status":"ready","db":"ok"}
```

### Test 4: Endpoint Count
```
✅ Total Active Endpoints: 1,311
  GET:    664 endpoints
  POST:   436 endpoints
  PUT:    87 endpoints
  DELETE: 100 endpoints
  PATCH:  20 endpoints
  HEAD:   4 endpoints
```
